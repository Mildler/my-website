                    if you are familiar with blender, then you know what the donut tutorial is. and, yes, i have begun the newest (concurrent) tutorial to get familiar with blender's tools and ui. i want to simply get somewhat comfortable with the interface and hopefully produce some models that i envision in my head. if it goes well, i might think about transferring the graphics of my video game. also, i began planning out building my http server. i am just trying to build as much skills as i can, but i feel that i may lack direction. specialization. i don't know what i'm doing, but i feel really motivated to do it.
