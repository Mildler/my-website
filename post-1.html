                    today, i am making it a statement. i am going to be learning/developing the skills necessary to commit to my project, and that involves more extensive knowledge of visual art, music, sound design, and coding. c sharp seems pretty similar to java, but learning proprietary unity tools in assistance is a bit of a learning curve. i suppose as is with any program--which, speaking of, i still have yet to learn cubase. it was such a money sink, i have to profit or die. anyway, 3d modeling is just an interest of mine and i am excited to learn a bit of blender to see if i am, at the very least, adequate enough to produce models that are direct translations of my sketches and imagination-manifested creatures. this was a meaningless nothing blurb, but to me it serves somewhat in accountability. i am also beginning my term at WGU in april, so we will see how that haul goes. hopefully by the end of this month, i'll be the second child in my family to have a degree. what a world we live in. (sorry, this post is bland and insipid, but once i get into the groove, things will pick up and prove more interesting. you'll see..
